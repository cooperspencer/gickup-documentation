- `token`: your sourcehut token. You don't need one, if you backup only public repositories. It can also be an environment variable.
- `token_file`: alternatively, specify the token in a file, relative to current working directory when executed.
- `url`: if empty, https://git.sr.ht is used.
- `user`: the user you want to clone the repositories from.
:::tip
if you want to get everything from your user, leave out the `user` parameter and just use the token.
:::
:::warning
for the clone process, either use:
 - username + password
 - sshkey
 - nothing, if you only clone public repositories
:::
- `username`: user that will be used for the clone process.
- `password`: password for said user.
- `ssh`: boolean value if the clone should be done via ssh.
- `sshkey`: if empty, it uses your home directories' .ssh/id_rsa.
- `exclude`: you can exclude repositories.
- `include`: only clone those specific repositories.
- `excludeorgs`: leave out specific organizations of the user.
- `includeorgs`: only clone those specific organizations repositories.
- `wiki`: also clone the wikis of the repositories.
- `filter`:
  - `lastactivity`: only repos that were active in this time frame are cloned (y, M, d, h, m, s)
