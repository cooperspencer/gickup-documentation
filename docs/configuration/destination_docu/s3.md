# S3

```yaml title="config"
destination:
  s3:
   - endpoint: somewhere:9000
     structured: true
     bucket: your-bucket-name
     accesskey: your-access-key
     secretkey: your-secret-key
     usessl: true
```
- `endpoint`: the endpoint of your s3 storage.
- `structured`: if set to `true`, it checks out the repos in a more structured way, like `hoster/user|organization/repository`.
- `bucket`: the name of your bucket.
- `accesskey`: the access key for your bucket. This can be an environment variable, just leave out the `$`-sign.
- `secretkey`: the secret key for your bucket. This can be an environment variable, just leave out the `$`-sign.
- `usessl`: wheter you use ssl or not.
