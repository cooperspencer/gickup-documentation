```
- `token`: your gogs token.
- `token_file`: alternatively, specify the token in a file, relative to current working directory when executed.
- `url`: there is no default value.
- `user`: the user/org you want to mirror the repositories to. 
- `createorg`: if activated, it will create the value in user as organization if it doesn't exist on the system.
:::tip
if `user` is empty and `createorg` is set to `true`, it creates organizations based on the original author.

  - `enabled`: if set to `false` gogs will handle the mirror process itself, if set to `true` gickup will clone the repo locally and push it to gogs.

    - `repositories`: can be `private` or `public`, default is `private`
- `force`: enable force push.
